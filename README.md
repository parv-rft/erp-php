*   **Reporting:** Generate various reports related to attendance, financials, etc.

## Tech Stack

*   **Backend:** PHP 8.1 (via Docker), CodeIgniter 3
*   **Frontend:** Likely HTML, CSS, JavaScript (based on `assets/` and `js/` directories)
*   **Database:** MySQL 8.0 (via Docker)
*   **Web Server:** Apache (via Docker)
*   **Containerization:** Docker, Docker Compose

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

*   [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
*   [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
*   [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) (Usually included with Docker Desktop)

## Installation and Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd <repository-directory>
    ```
    *(Replace `<your-repository-url>` and `<repository-directory>` with the actual URL and the name of the cloned folder)*

2.  **Environment Configuration (Optional):**
    If you need to override any default settings (e.g., database credentials for a different local setup, though the current Docker setup uses environment variables for MySQL), you can create a `.env` file in the project root.
    Copy `env.example` (if it existed, otherwise create `.env` manually) to `.env` and modify as needed:
    ```bash
    # cp env.example .env # If env.example exists
    # nano .env          # Or use your preferred editor
    ```
    *Note: The current `docker-compose.yml` handles database configuration via environment variables, so a `.env` file for the PHP application might not be immediately necessary unless you have other custom environment variables.*

3.  **Build and Start Containers:**
    This command builds the PHP/Apache image defined in `Dockerfile` and starts the `app` and `db` services defined in `docker-compose.yml`.
    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d --build
    ```

    *Alternative for importing database (using `docker exec` directly without `docker-compose`):*
    *   Find your database container ID: `docker ps` (look for the MySQL image)
    *   Copy the SQL file: `docker cp database_file/school.sql YOUR_CONTAINER_ID:/tmp/school.sql`
    *   Execute SQL: `docker exec -i YOUR_CONTAINER_ID mysql -u root school < /tmp/school.sql` (or use the interactive method shown above)

## Running the Application

*   **Start:** If the containers are stopped, start them with:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```
*   **Stop:** To stop the running containers:
    ```bash
    docker-compose down
    ```
    *(Running `docker-compose down` **will not** delete your database data, as it is stored in a persistent Docker volume (`db_data`).)*

## Accessing the Application

*   **URL:** Once the containers are running, access the application in your web browser at:
    [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

*   **Default Admin Credentials:**
    *   **Email:** `school@admin.com`
    *   **Password:** `12345`
    *(Other user roles likely have default credentials defined in the `database_file/school.sql` file)*

## Key Directories

*   `application/`: Contains the core CodeIgniter application code.
    *   `controllers/`: Handles incoming requests and orchestrates responses.
    *   `models/`: Interacts with the database.
    *   `views/`: Contains the HTML templates.
    *   `config/`: Application configuration files.
*   `system/`: CodeIgniter framework core files.
*   `database_file/`: Contains the database schema (`.sql` file).
*   `uploads/`: Directory for file uploads.
*   `assets/`, `js/`, `dist/`: Frontend assets (CSS, JavaScript, images, etc.).
*   `Dockerfile`: Defines the PHP/Apache application container image.
*   `docker-compose.yml`: Defines and configures the application and database services for Docker.

# PHP ERP Timetable Component Fixes

This README documents the fixes and improvements made to the timetable functionality in the PHP ERP system.

## Issues Fixed

1. **500 Internal Server Error**: The timetable was showing an infinite loader and not displaying properly, with a 500 Internal Server Error appearing in the console.

## Changes Made

### Backend (Controller) Improvements

1. **Admin Controller** (`application/controllers/Admin.php`):
   - Added comprehensive error handling with try-catch blocks
   - Improved validation of all inputs
   - Added automatic table creation if not exists
   - Added robust data validation before database operations
   - Implemented proper logging of actions and errors
   - Fixed resource loading and dependencies

2. **Timetable Model** (`application/models/Timetable_model.php`):
   - Created/updated model with essential functions
   - Implemented conflict checking for timetable entries
   - Added helper functions for retrieving timetable data
   - Fixed SQL query structure for better performance and security

### Frontend Improvements

The following files were updated with client-side improvements:
- `application/views/backend/admin/timetable.php`
- `application/views/backend/admin/timetable_view.php`
- `application/views/backend/student/timetable.php`
- `application/views/backend/teacher/timetable.php`
- `application/views/backend/teacher/timetable_view.php`

These changes included:
- JavaScript to force-hide loading indicators
- Implementation of error handling and console logging
- Improved DataTable initialization
- Better error handling for AJAX calls
- Fixed modal handling with error feedback
- Added CSS to ensure loaders stay hidden
- Used !important flags to ensure styles are applied

## How to Test

1. Login as an admin
2. Navigate to the Timetable section
3. Try viewing, creating, updating and deleting timetable entries
4. Verify that the loaders are hidden and content loads properly

## Future Improvements

1. Add client-side validation for timetable forms
2. Implement a timetable conflict checker in the UI
3. Create a more user-friendly timetable interface
4. Add drag and drop functionality for timetable management
